# forge link WIP

A very basic plugin to share code snippets, currently from github. 

Ideally in the future I would add the following features.

- links to other code forges
    - way for people to add extra forges as a config option
- generate a markdown snippet 
    - with the correct language tag
    ```LANG
    CODE HERE
    ```
